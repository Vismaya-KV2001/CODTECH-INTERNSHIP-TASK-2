Overview of the Project

Project:Car Price Prediction Using Linear Regression in Python

objective:
To predict the selling price of cars based on features such as age, mileage, fuel type, and transmission using linear regression. This project aims to provide data-driven insights for better decision-making in the car resale market.

Key Activities:
Data Loading and Exploration:Load the dataset and analyze the strucutre.

Data Preprocessing:Engineered a new feature (Car_Age) to replace the Year column. Encoded categorical variables (Fuel_Type, Seller_Type, Transmission) using one-hot encoding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):Visualized data trends and relationships using heatmaps and scatter plots. Identified key features affecting the selling price of cars.

Data Splitting:Separated the dataset into features (X) and target variable (y). Split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 ratio.

Model Building:Trained a Linear Regression model on the training data. Extracted model coefficients and evaluated its performance.

Model Evaluation:Predicted car prices on the test set. Assessed the model's performance using metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.

Technologies Used:

Python:The primary programming language for data analysis.

Pandas:Used for data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy – Utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays.

Scikit-learn – Used for building and evaluating the linear regression model, as well as splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Matplotlib:Employed for creating static,animated and interactive visualizations.

Seaborn:Utilized for making statistical graphics that are informative and attractive.

Visual Studio Code – The integrated development environment (IDE) used to write and execute the Python code.

Key Insights:
The car’s age is a critical factor influencing the selling price.
Cars with a manual transmission tend to have lower selling prices compared to automatic ones.
The Linear Regression model achieved an R-squared score of X.XX, indicating a good fit for the data.
Proper feature engineering and data visualization were essential in identifying trends and improving model accuracy.
